"gmeme" clientside cheat backdoor

Discovered @ 21.08.16 on http://www.mpgh.net/forum/showthread.php?t=1157555

Hidden and obfuscated in a clientside cheat. (see "stage1.lua")

When run, this code runs more hidden code ("stage2.lua"), which when de-obfuscated
using "gmeme_tft.lua", is "stage2_plain.lua", which reports the user's
IP & SteamID to "gmeme-kalis0x.c9users.io" when loading the cheat.

It also has the ability to run any code sent back from that site on the client who
ran the cheat.


The uploader on MPGH, "Liquid.Crew", is actually "cdriza":
