"Underdone" backdoor/DRM annoyance script.

Discovered @ 09.10.15


"troll_code.lua" fetches sounds and images from "http://www.underdone.org/leak" and
plays a remix of "Eiffel 65 - I'm blue" while flashing the screen and displaying
spinning images.

Found a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4rXjc60MPM

Harmless, but annoying.


Protection:
. Don't play on leaked RP gamemodes. Or any RP at all really.
