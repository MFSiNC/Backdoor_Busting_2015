I'm not havin' it.

I'm fed up with the ammount of GMod backdoors/server takeovers I keep finding.
This is a database of all the ones I've found in GMod workshop addons etc.

This information should help people trying to protect their servers from this crap.

You should read and understand all code you run on your servers.
DO NOT TRUST THE WORKSHOP. Scripts can update silently and add backdoors.

See the folders for information about each one.


EDIT 2016:
It seems a few clientside GMod hacks now have backdoors too..


./BD001_gpwn_new 						- gpwn backdoor, quite complex.
./BD002_Underdone			 			- Underdone backdoor/DRM annoyance script.
