Adds concommand "backdoor_ttt" to set the user's group to "superadmin"

Also contains disabled code to add the following IDs as admin:
STEAM_0:1:71900473

Edit 06.05.16:
This backdoor never existed in the original Customizable Weaponry 2, but
was probably added by someone who copied and re-uploaded the addon.
